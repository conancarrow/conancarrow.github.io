## Dissertation Abstract

The solution of strongly-coupled quantum systems with large numbers of constituents remains an active area of mathematical and computational research 100 years since the foundations of theoretical quantum physics were laid. Adapting modern numerical bootstrap and tensor-network techniques to this long-standing problem, we are able to circumvent the challenges posed by the large (formally infinite) number of interacting bodies in these systems. This Dissertation details two new techniques for computing rigorous bounds on quantum observables in the many-body problem:

1. The Spectral Bootstrap  
2. The Coarse-Grained Quantum Mechanics Bootstrap.

In each case, the technique leverages positivity of a Hilbert Space inner product, quantum commutation relations, and equations of motion to numerically constrain (“bootstrap”) the allowed values of observable data.
